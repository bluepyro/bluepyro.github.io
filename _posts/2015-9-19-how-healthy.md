Statistics from the Center of disease control show that in 2008, over 616,000 people died of heart disease causing almost 25% of the total deaths in that year. Also every year about 785,000 Americans have a first coronary attack. Another 470,000 who have already had one or more coronary attacks have another attack. As you can see this is a real problem, one that we should be aware of; but there are some tips to help you keeping yourself healthy and strong. 

In this article we are going to address a few methods or tips so you can avoid having a heart disease.
Cigars that kill
From all the ads you may watched on TV or in Movie theaters you must be already aware but there is a reason why we keep mention it, and that is because it is TRUE!
This nasty habit is one of the top risk factors for heart disease that can be controlled. So for this one you should really trust what it being repeated to you from so many different campaigns or ads or whatever you may want to call it.
Moving your body will save you!
Dancing is a good way to expend time and not just that, it also helps you burns some calories and helps you relax and also makes a great heart healthy workout. 
I will have Omega-3, thank you.
Including fish in your diet can reduce the risk of heart disease by a third or more. Fish are high in omega-3 fatty acids which is important for a normal metabolism. By this you will digest your food better and helps you not have that feeling of having a super full stomach were you almost canâ€™t breathe.
