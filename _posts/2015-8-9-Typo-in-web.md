Why do we go to a website?

<b>For information. To know something. To learn.</b>

The most popular reason for someone to go online is to get something useful but we can't understand that information or if it is too hard to read then what happens? Then that information is almost useless for us.

<b>The typography in a website is as important as  the content itself,</b> the easier it is for us to read something the easier it will be to understand its content. Typography is the core of a website, unless of course its only a gallery. Text is not just paragraph arranged in a nice way, it also needs to make people want to read it.

The thing about typography is that it works not just as a helper to make people understand something but also to convey emotions to the website. Knowing what letter face is better for what you want to express or what you need to say or do would help you getting around with people, and even telling them where the important parts are.
