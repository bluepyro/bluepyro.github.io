Cooking is a pleasure but sometimes is quite difficult to do so, that is why the best thing to do is looking for help. In this article we will show you 5 websites or blogs that shows you how to make some popular dishes for you and your family or even a friend gathering if you feel like. Not everyone is a cook but that does not mean you cannot learn!
Let’s start our list:

[<b>Allrecipes.com</b>](http://allrecipes.com/)

Whole food also has a section for recipes in their website. The good thing about this one is that you the recipes you can learn are made with stuff you can find their stores and as you know it will be healthy food as that is what they specialize. This also has a review section where you can read what other people think about the dish and if it’s good or not
