As you know pizza is one of the most popular food worldwide.  The problem is that when something is too popular starts to be overproduced, the same happens with pizza thatâ€™s why there are too many pizzerias that have this particular style of making them that feels way too processed.  In Doral a new restaurant is making their best to bring to you a better and different experience with the already well known, pizza.

We are already aware of how many places sell pizzas so even though their specialty are not pizzas they would make them also, as probably any Italian kind of restaurant. Located 41 street on Doral, the brand new Via Quarantuno (which means 41 in Italian) will be opening soon.

A new restaurant always means new possibilities and chances, the opening is one of the most important steps before knowing if this restaurant will take a nice turn or will end up badly. We cannot do more than speculate by now, but I as you should too, like to keep my mind positive so everything that happens I we could at least find a bright side to whatever it comes.

Via Quarantuno will be an Italian restaurant mostly but it will also count with many other dishes from all over Europe, so what they say even some French and maybe even Spanish dishes.

Stay alert to the news for more information. Via41, opening soon
