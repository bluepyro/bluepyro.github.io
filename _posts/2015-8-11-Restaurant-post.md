We know there are many days on the week or even during the weekend that you just want to eat something different or just something that you already know how it taste but you don't want to go to the same places all over again to probably eat the same food. We have been there too, that's why we decided to open our own restaurant in the doral area.

<b>Coming soon</b> we will open a restaurant called Vi41 (Via quarantuno -it's Italian-) but it would not be just another Italian restaurant as many others. Yest it will have pasta and pizza too, but besides that you will have an interesting variety of dishes and combinations you would not find anywhere else in the doral.

Our goal is not just to keep you satisfied with the food but to make you wanting to <b>try new things</b> every once in a while.
We are still working in the menu thats why I won't give you a sneak peek just yet. You will keep hearing from us as the time for the grand opening get closer.
